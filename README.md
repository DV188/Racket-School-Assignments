# Racket-School-Assignments
This repository contains solutions to assignment problems for my University's functional programming course.  Assignment solutions were written using [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/), an academic lisp like language.

Programs were built and tested using the Dr [Racket IDE](http://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/index.html?q=faq).
